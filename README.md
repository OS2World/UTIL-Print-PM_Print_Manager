# UTIL-Print-PM_Print_Manager
PM Printer Manager is a new graphical printer management tool designed to replace several older, separate programs by integrating their functions in one central tool. This includes creating standard OS/2 printers (local and LAN), creating CUPS-based printers, upgrading or downgrading IBM 'PrinterPak' driver packages, and creating new PostScript printer drivers by importing PPD files.
